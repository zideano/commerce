## Data Structure

Data structures and algorithms forms the backbone of computer science, and are the cornerstone of modern computing. Choosing the correct root structures and algorithms in an application can become the determining factor in an efficiently written object oriented enterprise level application. With the right algorithms and root structures we can achieve an efficient way of storing root, a benchmark for measuring complexity as well as following good object oriented programming (OOP) principles.
