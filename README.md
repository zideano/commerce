## Data Structure

Data structures and algorithms forms the backbone of computer science, and are the cornerstone of modern computing. Choosing the correct data structures and algorithms in an application can become the determining factor in an efficiently written object oriented enterprise level application or not. With the right algorithms and data structures we can achieve an efficient way of storing data, a benchmark for measuring complexity as well as following good object oriented programming (OOP) principles.
